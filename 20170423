How To Use A Macbook 

Now I got a macbook from my wife. She got it by work for the supermarket for two weeks. And I think this will be the chance for
me to learn about the Macbook and so I start to learn about it.

1.Finder
(1)DEVICE
Finder is to find any you want in the mac book. Just like some special file or something else. But anyway it seems that it is not
the same as file system of windows. We can use the bootcamp to access the file system of this mac book. Also it can be a good way
to use it just like windows. 
Also it has the remote disc and which can link to the remove file systems anyway.

(2)TAG
This is another function for macbook. Which can show the importance of the files. Also it has a great function that you can 
create different kinds of tags by yourself.

(3)Application/Download
This is a function that can show the application of this Mac and can also show the downloaded things of this mac book. Well, it
seems to be a good function anyway.

2.Launchpad

This is a function that makes the mac book just like a ipad. Any way it is a good way to make the mac just like a ipad. Also by
the DEVICE this make mac book like windows OS.

3.Airdrop

This is a function that makes it very easy to share files between devices between apple devices, this function is very fast and
we may use it to share data in a newest way. Why not use airdrop. Apple is not android. This function is based on blueteeth. Android
is not popular like before. Now Apple is still the king of the devices anyway. The method to use airdrop is to open finder and
click airdrop. It is fast to share data but anyway it is based on blueteeth.
